## 🚀 About Me  
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, My other account was banned so. press f for R.I.P. but anyways, I used to like to write scripts to hack an application. 
But now I decided to repent because it was a big sin (maybe). Now I focus on developing skills to develop an application, and aspire to become an amateur full stack developer lol.
