## 🚀 About Me  
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, My other account was banned so... press f for R.I.P☠️. but anyways, I used to like to write scripts to hack an application. 
But now I decided to repent because i think it was a big sin (kayanya sih). Now I focus on developing skills to develop an application, and aspire to become an amateur full stack developer lol.
